We specialize in crafting custom software solutions to fit your unique business needs. Our services range from designing and developing websites, and web-based apps, to native apps, either built from scratch or built on top of existing products.

With over a decade of experience in the startup tech industry, founders Ben Kimble and Jacob Luetzow have a proven track record of creating successful products such as AR/VR experiences, online learning platforms, blockchain projects, social platforms, fitness marketplace, and exercise apps.

Recognizing the need for a more tailored approach to software development, HGA rejects a one-size-fits-all approach and instead focuses on creating individualized, high-quality experiences for each customer.

We are committed to supporting the American workforce and exclusively employ software developers based in the United States. We do not outsource our work to other countries.
